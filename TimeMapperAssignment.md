# Latin American Revolutions - TimeMapper Assignment  
  
This assignment is designed for students to create a digital TimeMap that visually illustrates the major events, people, and places of the three Latin American Revolutions discussed in this course.  The idea is for students to work in a collaborative, public, online environment, to engage with new and interesting material, and to illustrate their work in a digital project.  
  
## Summary of assignment:  
The class will be split  into three student teams, one for each revolution planned to be covered in the course (Mexican Revolution, 1910-1920; Cuban Revolution, 1959-Present; Nicaraguan Revolution, 1979-1989). Each team is tasked with portraying their assigned revolution as a singular narrative by linking individual events, people, places, etc. together to produce a TimeMap.  
  
## Assignment Requirements:  
Each student team must use at least 8 academic sources, 4 must be primary (either print or visual) and 4 must be secondary, in researching their respective revolution. Proper citations in the Chicago Manual of Style must be used. Images and videos must also be cited in Chicago Manual of Style. Wikipedia images and YouTube videos are an acceptable source with proper citation.  
  
## Assignment Logistics:  
Each student team should navigate to [timemapper.okfnlabs.org](http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/) and follow the instructions carefully. EACH STUDENT TEAM SHOULD ALLOT ADEQUATE TIME TO BECOME WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIGITAL TOOL AND TO COMPLETE THE ASSIGNMENT PROPERLY. As part of the instructions each student team will create one Google Spreadsheet that will be used to generate the TimeMap.  It is important that every student member has access and can edit the spreadsheet. Once all team members have the link, one delegate from the team must send Dr. Herr the link via email. The same delegate will be responsible for emailing Dr. Herr the TimeMap link by the assignment due date below.  

Each student team will present their TimeMap during the last week of class.  Mexico will be on Monday, 4/15. Cuba will be on Wednesday, 4/17, and Nicaragua will be on Friday, 4/19.
